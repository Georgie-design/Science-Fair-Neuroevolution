This file gives insight into the 3d models

## Motor Holder
### Created 1/25/2024-ish

This was the first 3d-model created. I made it to verify that it would fit the motor using the measurements I was provided with. It was orginally solid, but I removed material to decrease waste.
The motor fit inside perfectly. Now that I knew that, I was able to use the model as a reference for the actual design, which is currently in development.
