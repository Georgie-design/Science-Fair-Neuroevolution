I have just created the activations folder and painstakenly filled it with the functions suggested by the cited sources. I created in another file to clean out the main file, which is growing rapidly. In the past week, I have began 
 to constructed the motor and genome classes. I also added some dummy code for the pin class. This will not actually be used in practice, as micropython supplies a module to controll the pins on the microcontroller. 
So far, the motor class initiates the pins for the motor and has some function skeletons for me to code later. I will initiate this class for all four motors when the time comes. On the other hand, for the genome class, it contains two arrays for the nodes and connections. The array contains the node and connection child class objects.
